In the original west coast gold rush the people selling the tools were ultimately the most successful. With this example in mind, NFT Scoring would be the people setting the price of gold and tracking its supply. They are competing in a marketplace that already has major players like OpenSea but due to the easy access of information at the NFT Scoring website it lends to break in opportunities.<br>It would be good to read <a href="https://www.z13o.com/post/ethereum-erc721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">THIS </a>post to understand this next point better. Currently most NFTs are off block chain assets linked in a URL in the NFT, calling out which are on and off block would be good to know as it effects the assets longevity and value.<br>This is such a new market it is hard to see what there is to disrupt other than the chaos of a new asset class. If we took a stab at it, we would guess that leveraging the API angle is possibly the strongest long term trajectory. Mobile NFT access is reliant on API access as mobile cannot load a full blockchain to verify if someone owns an NFT and relies on services like this to identify who owns what.</p><p></p><p></p><h5><strong>Market</strong></h5><p></p><p></p><p>The NFT sector is projected to reach $35B this year by some early adopters, and move on to 80B in 2025. Due to the lack of historical information on this market it is hard to tell if this is true, but if taken the history of Bitcoin into account it would point towards the market having longevity (not all smooth sailing). Since this is a speculatory market currently and vulnerable to fraud, it is a great market to be in data and not specifically holding off assets.</p><p></p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on July 20, 2023</div><div class="post__share"></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio box"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://z13o.com/authors/author/" title="The Author">The Author</a></h4><p>Collective account for multiple editors.Â </p></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="https://z13o.com/the-10-must-follow-marketing-tips-before-launching-an-app.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><img src="https://z13o.com/media/posts/35/responsive/1-1-scaled-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="" height="1027" width="2560"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>The 10 Must-Follow Marketing Tips before Launching an App</h5></div></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a href="https://z13o.com/heptabase-or-a-note-taking-tool-to-make-sense-of-complex-topics.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>Heptabase | A Note-Taking Tool To Make Sense of Complex Topics</h5></div><img src="https://z13o.com/media/posts/24/responsive/1-3-scaled-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="" height="1173" width="2560"></a></div></nav></footer></article></main><div class="sidebar"><section class="box authors"><h3 class="box__title">Authors</h3><ul class="authors__cotainer"><li class="authors__item"><div><a href="https://z13o.com/authors/author/" class="authors__title">The Author</a> <span class="u-small">Post: 36</span></div></li></ul></section><section class="box"><h3 class="box__title">Tags</h3><ul class="tags"><li><a href="https://z13o.com/tags/guides/">Guides</a> <span class="u-small">(8)</span></li><li><a href="https://z13o.com/tags/startups/">Startups</a> <span class="u-small">(23)</span></li><li><a href="https://z13o.com/tags/tech/">Tech</a> <span class="u-small">(21)</span></li></ul></section></div><footer class="footer"><a class="footer__logo" href="https://z13o.com/"><img src="https://z13o.com/media/website/z13o-low-resolution-logo-white-on-transparent-background-300x86.png" alt="z13o" width="300" height="86"></a><nav><ul class="footer__nav"></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
