Data Bridge Market Research analyses the market to grow at a CAGR of 3.20% in the above-mentioned forecast period. Growing traction of evidence-based treatment options and the development of novel drugs will assist in encouraging the growth of the market.</p><p></p><p></p><p>About 3 million Americans struggle with opioid use. Ophelia offers medication and support for quitting opioids. The company is based in New York, USA. Zack Gray is the founder and CEO of the company. It has 17 investors including General Catalyst and Four Acres Venture Capital. </p><p></p><p></p><p>The primary objective of Ophelia is to improve the health of people who have already used opioids or are currently using them. Its mission is to revive the traditional drug rehab model which is usually failed in most cases. They are currently operating in selected states like Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Maine, Maryland, Montana, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington, while still working to expand coverage nationwide.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Ophelia-affiliated physician group practices are independently owned and operated by licensed physicians who provide services utilizing the Ophelia telehealth platform. They have got best healthcare providers, scientists, techies, and citizens with a mission to offer medication-assisted treatment (MAT). It has been shown in studies to be at least 3x more effective than stopping opioids without medication. MAT is considered the most effective treatment for opioid use disorder by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other federal agencies. </p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figure class="wp-image-941"><img loading="lazy" src="https://z13o.com/media/posts/14/1-1-1024x411.jpg" alt="doctor writing notes about patient" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://z13o.com/media/posts/14/responsive/1-1-1024x411-xs.jpg 300w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/14/responsive/1-1-1024x411-sm.jpg 480w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/14/responsive/1-1-1024x411-md.jpg 768w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/14/responsive/1-1-1024x411-lg.jpg 1024w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/14/responsive/1-1-1024x411-xl.jpg 1360w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/14/responsive/1-1-1024x411-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure></figure><p></p><p></p><p>Ophelia treats its patients with Suboxone which is the combination of Buprenorphine and Naloxone and binds with the receptors with which traditional opioids bind. It is used as an FDA-approved long-term maintenance treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) and is available in the tablet form which is placed sublingually.</p><p></p><p></p><p>With Ophelia, one will be assigned a dedicated healthcare care team comprised of a prescribing clinical, nurse, and care coordinator to help one get on Suboxone comfortably and safely. Another drug that is highly recommended is Naltrexone, this medication blocks the opioid receptors, preventing patients from experiencing the effects of opioids while reducing the craving to use them.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The company's providers make sure to offer one with unprejudiced and sympathetic care to its clients. One can have a free consultation call with a member of the support team to clear all the queries one might have. One can meet the care team, which is made up of prescribing clinician, a nurse, and a care coordinator on the video call. The prescribing clinician will review the medical history and propose a treatment plan accordingly.</p><p></p><p></p><p>One might be able to pick up the initial suboxone prescription the same day as the first visit. One can speak to a clinician on a weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly basis and book an appointment for whatever time suits one as they are open 7-days a week and anytime in the day or night. The pricing is very simple and low cost. The Ophelia membership includes all Ophelia clinician visits via video calls, Suboxone management, and Ongoing support from the dedicated Ophelia care team for only $195 per month if not on insurance. </p><p></p><p></p><p>Ophelia is continually working to become in-network with as many insurance companies as possible in the states they operate in. However, the coverage isn’t the same in every state because health plan has indicated that they do not wish to contract with Ophelia because they already have an adequate network of MAT providers, Ophelia has just recently begun providing substance abuse disorder services in a state, with contracts yet to be finalized and the health plan and Ophelia cannot agree on the key terms to finalize a contract.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Visit their <a href="https://ophelia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="website">website</a> to learn more.</p><p></p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on July 20, 2023</div><div class="post__share"></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio box"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://z13o.com/authors/author/" title="The Author">The Author</a></h4><p>Collective account for multiple editors. </p></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="https://z13o.com/chipmakers-will-suffer-as-russia-limits-exports-of-rare-gases.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><img src="https://z13o.com/media/posts/19/responsive/1-2-scaled-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="" height="947" width="2560"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>Chipmakers Will Suffer As Russia Limits Exports Of Rare Gases</h5></div></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a href="https://z13o.com/how-pardes-biosciences-helps-stop-the-pandemic-and-prevent-the-next.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>How Pardes Biosciences Helps Stop The Pandemic and Prevent The Next</h5></div><img src="https://z13o.com/media/posts/13/responsive/17-scaled-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="" height="1706" width="2560"></a></div></nav></footer></article></main><div class="sidebar"><section class="box authors"><h3 class="box__title">Authors</h3><ul class="authors__cotainer"><li class="authors__item"><div><a href="https://z13o.com/authors/author/" class="authors__title">The Author</a> <span class="u-small">Post: 36</span></div></li></ul></section><section class="box"><h3 class="box__title">Tags</h3><ul class="tags"><li><a href="https://z13o.com/tags/guides/">Guides</a> <span class="u-small">(8)</span></li><li><a href="https://z13o.com/tags/startups/">Startups</a> <span class="u-small">(23)</span></li><li><a href="https://z13o.com/tags/tech/">Tech</a> <span class="u-small">(21)</span></li></ul></section></div><footer class="footer"><a class="footer__logo" href="https://z13o.com/"><img src="https://z13o.com/media/website/z13o-low-resolution-logo-white-on-transparent-background-300x86.png" alt="z13o" width="300" height="86"></a><nav><ul class="footer__nav"></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
