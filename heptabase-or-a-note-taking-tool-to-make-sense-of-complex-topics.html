First thought, this opens up opportunities to training and knowledge transfer in methods other than a list of book marks in a Slack channel or pointing someone at a Confluence board.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The second thought we had while reviewing Heptabase is the possibility it has to support Memory Palace styles of data organization. The market has a lot of "note taking" products currently, however only a few teams are reinventing how the data is visualized (not to be confused with organization). The top 5 note taking apps you can think of have a left side bar for note or page names and a center section for content. Heptabase diverges from the standard market model so much it feels like a new product.</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figure class="wp-image-948"><img loading="lazy" src="https://z13o.com/media/posts/24/1-3-1024x469.jpg" alt="woman teaching a boy" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://z13o.com/media/posts/24/responsive/1-3-1024x469-xs.jpg 300w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/24/responsive/1-3-1024x469-sm.jpg 480w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/24/responsive/1-3-1024x469-md.jpg 768w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/24/responsive/1-3-1024x469-lg.jpg 1024w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/24/responsive/1-3-1024x469-xl.jpg 1360w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/24/responsive/1-3-1024x469-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure></figure><p></p><p></p><p>Currently Heptabase is a manual or semi manual process for creating and editing documentation, however there is a real value here in generating documentation from Git or Jira data sources to offer a backwards compatible service. Imagine if all the documentation you wish you had for internal products was programmatically solvable by a ML service that imported it into a Heptabase? It would be documentation for technical debit organized in an easy to read and learn visual learning tool.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Starting a customer base is always harder than borrowing your competitors. In our opinion, integrations with current market heavy weights like GitHub or Jira would allow for easier opt-in customer acquisitions. The product is differentiated enough in concept to not get an apples to apples comparison from early adopters and could lead to better brand recognition.</p><p></p><p></p><h5><strong>Market</strong></h5><p></p><p></p><p>Heptabase has a possible seat in-between the Office Productivity and Software Development Tools sectors, as both markets could leverage such a tool. Currently Google and Microsoft are dominating Office Productivity with companies like Evernote winning in smaller sectors of the market. Software Development Tools is a more fractured market with many solutions not fully over lapping on services. Most of the Software Development Tools require heavy API integrations to stay competitive since the market is a landing point for breakout data from the Software Configuration Management market. Software Configuration Management is dominated by GitHub, GitLab, and others. Software tools as a whole is estimated to reach $158B globally in 2022.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Visit their <a href="https://heptabase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="website">website</a> to learn more.</p><p></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on July 20, 2023</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://z13o.com/tags/startups/">Startups</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://z13o.com/authors/author/" rel="author">Author</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://z13o.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://z13o.com/nft-scoring.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> NFT Scoring</a></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-10-10T00:00" class="feed__date">October 10, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://z13o.com/how-two-dots-make-underwriting-easy-and-secure.html">How Two Dots Make Underwriting Easy and Secure</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-09-02T00:00" class="feed__date">September 2, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://z13o.com/how-to-make-a-wireframe-in-figma.html">How to make a wireframe in figma</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-08-26T00:00" class="feed__date">August 26, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://z13o.com/chipmakers-will-suffer-as-russia-limits-exports-of-rare-gases.html">Chipmakers Will Suffer As Russia Limits Exports Of Rare Gases</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://z13o.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://z13o.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
