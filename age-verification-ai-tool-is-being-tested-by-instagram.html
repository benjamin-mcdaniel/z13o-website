Any user thirteen years of age can sign-up for an Instagram account, however, the company was not interested in checking whether this rule was not enforced or not since 2019. After criticism from experts on the platform's privacy and child safety policies, Instagram has ensured various methods to verify age and also to filter out the younger population of users. Nowadays, Instagrammers are required to verify their ages after they try to edit their birth dates through their government-issued IDs.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p>Users living in the US can either can use Artificial Intelligence estimation of age or social vouching. In AI estimation of age, Instagram has made use of a web app called 'Yoti' in which the users are required to send their video selfies and then uses AI algorithms to confirm a user's age. In the social vouching method, Instagram will send a request to three mutual followers to verify their age and they will have three days to respond to the request.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p>Yoti is a renowned app for the purpose of verification of IDs and the online age of the users. It is a trusted app by the British government and as well as German policymakers. It is an artificial intelligence-driven app that uses machine learning to analyze the facial signals of a user to confirm their age. Yoti is safe to use as it does not save any information or personal data of the users but the app can have trouble estimating age with darker skin tones and female gender. Analysis of Yoti's systems by a non-profit revealed that the platform was 98.89% reliable in confirming whether or not users had greater than 18 years of age and below 25 years of age.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p>Instagram does not resort to the use of Yoti only. Since 2019, the company has been utilizing automated algorithms on the lookout for underage users. These systems make use of the user's birthday posts and the average age of their friends in various groups. For instance, if a user fakes his/her age as 20 but their posts are about them celebrating their 17th birthday. In such a case, Instagram will flag their accounts as suspicious activity and such users might have to provide proof of age. Instagram is actively working to get better at this system by adding new data points and also testing language tool which will determine their age group based on their writing style.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four"><figure class="wp-image-650"><img loading="lazy" src="https://z13o.com/media/posts/18/george-orwell-quotes-header-min-1024x576.jpg" alt="" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://z13o.com/media/posts/18/responsive/george-orwell-quotes-header-min-1024x576-xs.jpg 300w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/18/responsive/george-orwell-quotes-header-min-1024x576-sm.jpg 480w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/18/responsive/george-orwell-quotes-header-min-1024x576-md.jpg 768w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/18/responsive/george-orwell-quotes-header-min-1024x576-lg.jpg 1024w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/18/responsive/george-orwell-quotes-header-min-1024x576-xl.jpg 1360w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/18/responsive/george-orwell-quotes-header-min-1024x576-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure></a></figure><p></p><p></p><p>George Orwell wrote a very famous novel named '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four">1984</a>' in which he discussed how governments will carry out mass surveillance of the people to keep a check on them and their activities. Although this book was written by Orwell in 1949 it seems that it was written for the world of today. The novel predicts the future in the year to come i.e., 1984 where the world will see perpetual wars, endless surveillance and brainwashing of the masses, and, propaganda. It can be easily seen today how the governments and private business entities use the masses for their personal gains. Instagram's idea of confirming the age of its users is nothing more than a breach of privacy to some extent. It's not the age that will concern the users but how such information is obtained may lead to a breach of data on a bigger level. Consequently, the users might be unwilling to share their government-issued IDs and video selfies and disregard such a method of Instagram as nothing more than trying to get more information from the public.</p><p></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://z13o.com/tags/tech/">Tech</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://z13o.com/authors/author/" rel="author">Author</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://z13o.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://z13o.com/how-dualityai-improve-machine-learning-and-robotics.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> How Duality.ai Improve Machine Learning and Robotics</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://z13o.com/how-h1-create-a-healthier-future.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> How H1 Create A Healthier Future </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://z13o.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-10-21T00:00" class="feed__date">October 21, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://z13o.com/heptabase-or-a-note-taking-tool-to-make-sense-of-complex-topics.html">Heptabase | A Note-Taking Tool To Make Sense of Complex Topics</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>All Rights Reserved 2023</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://z13o.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://z13o.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'overlay',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
