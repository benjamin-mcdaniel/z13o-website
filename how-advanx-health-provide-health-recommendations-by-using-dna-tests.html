It's the lack of understanding of their health condition and taking initiative at the proper time. They gathered a team of like-minded healthcare professionals to start Advanx Health, to provide understandable and reliable personalized health information as a guide for patients to work towards living a healthier life. They want to empower one&nbsp;to take charge of their health by providing a personal genomics discovery experience.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Advanx has taken this initiative which others never thought about it to let you know about your body better and help decode the DNA which can affect you in various ways. It can help you discover the traits that affect you and teach you how to eat smarter. It can help you detect the allergies and sensitivities like some people who can't stand the fur of animals or maybe they have a peanut allergy, motion sickness, or are lactose intolerant.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Furthermore, It helps in understanding muscle endurance, muscle power, and lactate threshold. Also, it can give better knowledge about health risks, your personality, and the carrier status like Beta-thalassemia, Phenylketonuria, Biotinidase deficiency, Sickle cell anemia, Tay-Sachs disease, etc.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figure class="wp-image-829"><img loading="lazy" src="https://z13o.com/media/posts/28/1-3-1024x439.jpg" alt="A hand holding a old man's hand" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://z13o.com/media/posts/28/responsive/1-3-1024x439-xs.jpg 300w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/28/responsive/1-3-1024x439-sm.jpg 480w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/28/responsive/1-3-1024x439-md.jpg 768w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/28/responsive/1-3-1024x439-lg.jpg 1024w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/28/responsive/1-3-1024x439-xl.jpg 1360w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/28/responsive/1-3-1024x439-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure></figure><p></p><p></p><p>Their procedure is simple one should select and make payment for the reports plus a one-time lab handling fee and then wait until our team will be sending a kit to your doorstep including a saliva collection kit, funnel, saliva collection tube, and instruction sheet. One should collect the saliva sample and then ship it back to our company and then wait for good 4-6 weeks until your reports get ready. And Bang!!! You just decoded a secret part of you.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Saliva samples are processed in an ISO17025-accredited laboratory in a renowned research institute in Malaysia. The laboratory personnel are scientists that are trained in running the workflow with high austerity. Also, the personalized reports are based on the curated database of well-established, peer-reviewed publications. One's reports are also proofread by Ph.D. scientists, and there will be citations in the report for all contents.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Visit their <a href="https://www.advanxhealth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="website">website</a> to learn more.</p><p></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://z13o.com/tags/startups/">Startups</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://z13o.com/authors/author/" rel="author">Author</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://z13o.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://z13o.com/ramper-or-buy-eth-btc-and-more-in-minutes.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Ramper | Buy ETH, BTC, and more in minutes</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://z13o.com/5-easy-to-download-apps-every-startup-has-to-have.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> 5 Easy-to-download Apps Every Startup Has To Have </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://z13o.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-10-12T00:00" class="feed__date">October 12, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://z13o.com/how-simone-health-transforms-the-lives-of-women.html">How Simone Health Transforms The Lives Of Women</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-09-07T00:00" class="feed__date">September 7, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://z13o.com/how-h1-create-a-healthier-future.html">How H1 Create A Healthier Future</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>All Rights Reserved 2023</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://z13o.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://z13o.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'overlay',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
