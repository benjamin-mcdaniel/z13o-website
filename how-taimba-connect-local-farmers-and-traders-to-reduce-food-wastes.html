Food wastage is caused by many reasons including bad weather, overproduction, unstable markets, overbuying, and unstable markets.&nbsp; It costs the country approximately 4 billion dollars annually, enough to feed 48 million people. This act of wasting valuable resources puts detrimental strain on the environment.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Enter Taimba is a Nairobi-based Agri-tech, a company that is transforming Africa’s agricultural supply chain between rural smallholder farmers and urban traders.</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figure class="wp-image-835"><img loading="lazy" src="https://z13o.com/media/posts/27/1-5-1024x513.jpg" alt="farm field" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://z13o.com/media/posts/27/responsive/1-5-1024x513-xs.jpg 300w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/27/responsive/1-5-1024x513-sm.jpg 480w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/27/responsive/1-5-1024x513-md.jpg 768w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/27/responsive/1-5-1024x513-lg.jpg 1024w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/27/responsive/1-5-1024x513-xl.jpg 1360w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/27/responsive/1-5-1024x513-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure></figure><p></p><p></p><h5>Taimba</h5><p></p><p></p><p>It's a mobile-based cashless platform that connects farmers to retailers and has been working with smallholder farmers to ensure they access consistency in the market, and fair prices by shortening the agriculture supply chain. The company understands Farmers and guarantees them to get paid right and on time. Whereas, the company's retailers network offers a ready market while abolishing operational confrontations.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p>According to Kenya Food Security Steering Group's 2019 Short Rains Assessment, Nearly 1.3 million people in Kenya face the worst acute food insecurity. Keeping this in mind Taimba came up with a vision to eradicate food shortage by optimizing the distribution, quality, and price of food in East Africa, through a data-driven, innovative and intelligent supply chain.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Taimba is focused on the relationship with Farmers and Retailers. To them, they are not just trading partners, but friends that they just happen to do business with. The company focuses on the products that are at risk of market price volatility, seasons, and have a short shelf life for example potatoes, onions, carrots, and tomatoes. It has inexpensive and garden-fresh produce which could be bought using a phone, delivering within no time.</p><p></p><p></p><p>People don't have to go to market early in the morning to get fresh produce, rather the product is delivered to its customers promptly. It also links farmers to partners who provide support to farmers on best agricultural practices. The products could be easily tracked to the source of its products hence increasing its accountability and safety across the supply chain.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Visit their <a href="https://taimba.co.ke/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="website">website</a> to learn more.</p><p></p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on July 20, 2023</div><div class="post__share"></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio box"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://z13o.com/authors/author/" title="The Author">The Author</a></h4><p>Collective account for multiple editors. </p></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="https://z13o.com/how-wheels-take-driving-to-next-level.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><img src="https://z13o.com/media/posts/11/responsive/13-scaled-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="" height="1920" width="2560"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>How Wheels Take Driving To Next Level</h5></div></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a href="https://z13o.com/ramper-or-buy-eth-btc-and-more-in-minutes.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>Ramper | Buy ETH, BTC, and more in minutes</h5></div><img src="https://z13o.com/media/posts/26/responsive/11-scaled-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="" height="2079" width="2560"></a></div></nav><div class="post__related box"><h3 class="box__title">Related posts</h3><div class="post__related-wrap"><figure class="post__related-item"><a href="https://z13o.com/firstignite-connecting-universities-and-sponsors.html" class="c-card__image"><img src="https://z13o.com/media/posts/16/responsive/FirstIgnite_logo_full-xs.png" loading="lazy" height="608" width="2902" alt=""></a><figcaption><h4 class="post__related-title"><a href="https://z13o.com/firstignite-connecting-universities-and-sponsors.html" class="inverse">FirstIgnite - Connecting Universities and Sponsors</a></h4><time datetime="2022-08-19T00:00" class="u-small">August 19, 2022</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article></main><div class="sidebar"><section class="box authors"><h3 class="box__title">Authors</h3><ul class="authors__cotainer"><li class="authors__item"><div><a href="https://z13o.com/authors/author/" class="authors__title">The Author</a> <span class="u-small">Post: 36</span></div></li></ul></section><section class="box"><h3 class="box__title">Tags</h3><ul class="tags"><li><a href="https://z13o.com/tags/guides/">Guides</a> <span class="u-small">(8)</span></li><li><a href="https://z13o.com/tags/startups/">Startups</a> <span class="u-small">(23)</span></li><li><a href="https://z13o.com/tags/tech/">Tech</a> <span class="u-small">(21)</span></li></ul></section></div><footer class="footer"><a class="footer__logo" href="https://z13o.com/"><img src="https://z13o.com/media/website/z13o-low-resolution-logo-white-on-transparent-background-300x86.png" alt="z13o" width="300" height="86"></a><nav><ul class="footer__nav"></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
