Wheels devices have a low center of gravity and 14-inch wheels to help navigate uneven pavement surfaces. Wheels recently launched a first-of-its-kind integrated helmet system that gives riders physical access to a shareable helmet with every ride they take. Because of its unique design, Wheels devices have a broad appeal, with half of its riders being women and one-third being over 35. Wheels is headquartered in Los Angeles, California, and is currently expanding operations across the U.S. and Europe.</p><p></p><p></p><p>It's the breaking new ground micro-mobility that provides a spotlight journey and boosts one's day. It has 4 times fewer injuries than bikes and up to 66 times fewer injuries than scooters. It is trusted by Uber Eats, Lime, Google, Forbes, Lime, Helbiz, etc. Also, it provides cozy and easy micro-mobility devices consisting of pleasant seats, a safety helmet, and self-sanitizing handlebars and brake lever which could be rented through an app in cities around the world. “We created Wheels to give people a convenient, safe way to get around while beating traffic and limiting environmental impact,” said Marco McCottry, CEO of Wheels.</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figure class="wp-image-838"><img loading="lazy" src="https://z13o.com/media/posts/11/1-6-1024x430.jpg" alt="crowded street" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://z13o.com/media/posts/11/responsive/1-6-1024x430-xs.jpg 300w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/11/responsive/1-6-1024x430-sm.jpg 480w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/11/responsive/1-6-1024x430-md.jpg 768w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/11/responsive/1-6-1024x430-lg.jpg 1024w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/11/responsive/1-6-1024x430-xl.jpg 1360w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/11/responsive/1-6-1024x430-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure></figure><p></p><p></p><h5>Wheels and Covid-19 protocols</h5><p></p><p></p><p>Since the start of the covid pandemic people used to avoid social contact as much as they can. Public transportation and car ride-sharing are fundamentally incompatible with social distancing, riding Wheels allows people to do necessary travel without having to be close to others. It gives the option of long-term rentals as well starting from $89.99 per month which provides unlimited rides for the entire length of one's rental. It's completely galvanic with a top speed of 18Mph with a sound system.</p><p></p><p></p><p>There is so much in the detail consisting of an incorporated braking system with zero revealed wires. It has a self-diagnostic system in which the sensors detect the problems and send it to the team so that they could resolve the problem within no time. On top of everything, it's eco-friendly. It reduces the number of cars on the road which ultimately reduces the carbon emissions thus protecting the planet earth. The wheels offer the students and faculty members of universities and schools to move around the campus with comfort and ease.</p><p></p><p></p><h5>Future of bike and scooter rental</h5><p></p><p></p><p>The supply chain of the bike and scooter market was disrupted in the year 2020. Slowly it started to hike from the beginning of the year 2021 with certain Standard operating procedures (SOPs). According to Vantage Market research(VMR), the future bike and scooter rental market economy size is expected growth by $11,040 Million by 2028.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Moreover, the bike and scooter market is projected to have a significant growth rate in 2022-2027. According to the World Tourism Organization, almost 1.5 billion international tourist arrivals were recorded in 2019, across the world. The travel industry has been ceaselessly encountering growth and enlarging to become one of the fastest-growing profitable and economic segments across the globe over the past few years. ‎Current tourism is associated with the development and incorporates a rising number ‎of different new destinations.</p><p></p><p></p><p>These changing aspects have turned tourism into a key driver of ‎economic progress and are in turn anticipated to augment the growth of the bike and scooter rental market in the years to come. There are approximately 20 million e-scooter users in Europe and It is said that the market could be valued at €100 billion by 2030. It takes only a few dollars to ride e-scooters or e-bikes anywhere a person wants and is less expensive than cabs providing swift navigation on overflowing roadways.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Visit their <a href="https://takewheels.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="website">website</a> to learn more.</p><p></p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on July 20, 2023</div><div class="post__share"></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio box"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://z13o.com/authors/author/" title="The Author">The Author</a></h4><p>Collective account for multiple editors. </p></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="https://z13o.com/ethereum-erc721.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><img src="https://z13o.com/media/posts/4/responsive/SEI_125161736-e1664929036122-xs.webp" loading="lazy" alt="" height="352" width="778"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>Ethereum ERC721</h5></div></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a href="https://z13o.com/how-taimba-connect-local-farmers-and-traders-to-reduce-food-wastes.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>How Taimba Connect Local Farmers and Traders To Reduce Food Wastes</h5></div><img src="https://z13o.com/media/posts/27/responsive/12-scaled-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="" height="1707" width="2560"></a></div></nav><div class="post__related box"><h3 class="box__title">Related posts</h3><div class="post__related-wrap"><figure class="post__related-item"><a href="https://z13o.com/how-pardes-biosciences-helps-stop-the-pandemic-and-prevent-the-next.html" class="c-card__image"><img src="https://z13o.com/media/posts/13/responsive/17-scaled-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="1706" width="2560" alt=""></a><figcaption><h4 class="post__related-title"><a href="https://z13o.com/how-pardes-biosciences-helps-stop-the-pandemic-and-prevent-the-next.html" class="inverse">How Pardes Biosciences Helps Stop The Pandemic and Prevent The Next</a></h4><time datetime="2022-08-31T00:00" class="u-small">August 31, 2022</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article></main><div class="sidebar"><section class="box authors"><h3 class="box__title">Authors</h3><ul class="authors__cotainer"><li class="authors__item"><div><a href="https://z13o.com/authors/author/" class="authors__title">The Author</a> <span class="u-small">Post: 36</span></div></li></ul></section><section class="box"><h3 class="box__title">Tags</h3><ul class="tags"><li><a href="https://z13o.com/tags/guides/">Guides</a> <span class="u-small">(8)</span></li><li><a href="https://z13o.com/tags/startups/">Startups</a> <span class="u-small">(23)</span></li><li><a href="https://z13o.com/tags/tech/">Tech</a> <span class="u-small">(21)</span></li></ul></section></div><footer class="footer"><a class="footer__logo" href="https://z13o.com/"><img src="https://z13o.com/media/website/z13o-low-resolution-logo-white-on-transparent-background-300x86.png" alt="z13o" width="300" height="86"></a><nav><ul class="footer__nav"></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
