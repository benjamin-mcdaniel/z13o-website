The wallet team was part of MIT Playlabs, StartupBoostLA, and ETCLabs, San Francisco. One can buy, store and spend crypto in telegram messenger. It has almost 80 000 users from 118 countries mainly the UK, US, Russia, and Indonesia, and has a partnership with waves, MakerDAO and DAI, Changelly, stellar, and many more partnerships which will be announced shortly. Coinbase Wallet,&nbsp; ZenGo, Exodus, and Metamask are other top crypto wallets.BUTTON Wallet A safe and convenient way to store and exchange digital assets within one's Telegram account.

Whereas, the CCO of the company is Rachael McCrary who is a Designer, Marketer, and Funding expert.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The company has developed the most user-friendly wallet which would allow other people to do transactions and exchange cryptocurrency with fiat money as easily as bank transfers like Venmo in crypto. The best advantage users have is that the company doesn't store users' private keys rather than kept them by users themselves. Most of the time in other multi-currency solutions the users have to store a lot of incomprehensible texts whereas with Button wallet one can store all the secret keys to each cryptocurrency in one QR which is encrypted with their password. The Bot is already installed in a regular messenger and cannot be blocked as it's part of Telegram messenger. In its bot, one can exchange from one cryptocurrency to another cryptocurrency in a couple of clicks using atomic swap technology which is an exchange of cryptocurrencies from separate blockchains. With Button, one can buy and sell tokens and exchange cryptocurrency swiftly which is otherwise on the stock exchange it requires complex registration and requires know-how to trade. It comes up with providing a speedy way into the operations of the majority of holders of cryptocurrencies that use Telegram. The pith characteristic of the project is a secure transaction signing library for easy clients. The code of which is open, which means attracting other developers interested in using the library to audit the code for security. The world is progressing so fast that it's believed that even ordinary economics will be digital in the upcoming days. Moreover, people are afraid that they might lose money as there is a lot of news about centralized companies losing their money due to some failure. Also, it's very difficult for a layman to understand cryptography and mathematics. To solve this problem Button came up with the idea of decentralized digital economics. The competitive advantage of Button is that 90% of the crypto holders use Telegram and the wallet itself is telegram based.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The company has collaborated with Ethereum Classic, an open-source, blockchain-based distributed computing platform featuring smart contract functionality.
