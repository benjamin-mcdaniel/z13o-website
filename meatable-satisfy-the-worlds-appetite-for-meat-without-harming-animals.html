Moreover, It is believed that beef production causes greenhouse gas emissions through the agricultural production process and land-use change. One should keep in mind that Greenhouse gases are responsible for global warming which could deteriorate the planet entirely. To address these issues Meatable came into existence. The Company produces real and guilt-free meat, which is made from cell linings of original animals which means one hasn't had to kill the animals for the sake of meat. The guilt-free meat is the same as the real meat in texture as well as taste. The company aims to appease the world's longing for meat without maltreating people and animals. It is pioneering in the production of meat without any harm and drawbacks. It ensures efficient, sustainable, and harm-free meat.</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://meatable.com/"><figure class="wp-image-570"><img loading="lazy" src="https://z13o.com/media/posts/2/Meatable-Vertical-Farming_LinkedIn-Spon-1200x627-1-1024x535.jpg" alt="metables infographic" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://z13o.com/media/posts/2/responsive/Meatable-Vertical-Farming_LinkedIn-Spon-1200x627-1-1024x535-xs.jpg 300w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/2/responsive/Meatable-Vertical-Farming_LinkedIn-Spon-1200x627-1-1024x535-sm.jpg 480w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/2/responsive/Meatable-Vertical-Farming_LinkedIn-Spon-1200x627-1-1024x535-md.jpg 768w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/2/responsive/Meatable-Vertical-Farming_LinkedIn-Spon-1200x627-1-1024x535-lg.jpg 1024w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/2/responsive/Meatable-Vertical-Farming_LinkedIn-Spon-1200x627-1-1024x535-xl.jpg 1360w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/2/responsive/Meatable-Vertical-Farming_LinkedIn-Spon-1200x627-1-1024x535-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure></a></figure><p></p><p></p><p>The company doesn't keep any secrets but rather shares the real science behind its product. Firstly the sample is taken from an unharmed pig or cow and then replicates the natural process of fat and muscle and mixes two elements to produce meat. This whole process takes a couple of weeks instead of waiting for a cow around 2-to 3 years to develop enough meat to get it slaughtered. No antibiotics are used during the process. Trees are saved which are otherwise used for the grazing of animals leading to deforestation. To produce 1 pound of beef, 1799 gallons of water are used. Also, the average western diet comprises over 1000 animals in a lifetime but thanks to the company no slaughtering are done. The company is doing its best so far to satisfy its customers.</p><p></p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on July 20, 2023</div><div class="post__share"></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio box"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://z13o.com/authors/author/" title="The Author">The Author</a></h4><p>Collective account for multiple editors. </p></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__next"><a href="https://z13o.com/button-wallet-a-crypto-wallet-on-telegram.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>Button Wallet - a crypto wallet on Telegram</h5></div><img src="https://z13o.com/media/posts/7/responsive/buttonBanner-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="" height="642" width="1280"></a></div></nav></footer></article></main><div class="sidebar"><section class="box authors"><h3 class="box__title">Authors</h3><ul class="authors__cotainer"><li class="authors__item"><div><a href="https://z13o.com/authors/author/" class="authors__title">The Author</a> <span class="u-small">Post: 36</span></div></li></ul></section><section class="box"><h3 class="box__title">Tags</h3><ul class="tags"><li><a href="https://z13o.com/tags/guides/">Guides</a> <span class="u-small">(8)</span></li><li><a href="https://z13o.com/tags/startups/">Startups</a> <span class="u-small">(23)</span></li><li><a href="https://z13o.com/tags/tech/">Tech</a> <span class="u-small">(21)</span></li></ul></section></div><footer class="footer"><a class="footer__logo" href="https://z13o.com/"><img src="https://z13o.com/media/website/z13o-low-resolution-logo-white-on-transparent-background-300x86.png" alt="z13o" width="300" height="86"></a><nav><ul class="footer__nav"></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
