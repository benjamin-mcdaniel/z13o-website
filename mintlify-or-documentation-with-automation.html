Currently there are 2 products "Writer" and "Connect" which served both B2C and B2B customers by integrating either with and end users IDE or A Git Repo of your choice.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Initial impressions, the products look good and if they delivered only half of what is currently out it would be a win.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Lets first go over the "fixit list" and get it out of the way so we don't sour what looks to be a very good product delivery. Mintlify currently offers only "addon" service with little defensible moat to protect from clones. Like we mentioned above, they integrate with Git Repos and IDEs which has little to no data.</p><p></p><p></p><p>When deadlines are pushed, delivery is behind, and you need to ship, sometimes documentation falls by the wayside. Mintilfy in this example would meet a moderate level of documentation needs with very low cost. This would not replace product-centric documentation but it will prevent "do you have a quick second" meetings about code that was written 6 months ago.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Like everything in tech adoption criteria are always different with the 1 exception of need for backwards compatibility. Mintlify Is positioned really well to be backwards compatible without affecting legacy code in an adverse way.</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figure class="wp-image-844"><img loading="lazy" src="https://z13o.com/media/posts/5/1-7-1024x413.jpg" alt="AI and networks" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://z13o.com/media/posts/5/responsive/1-7-1024x413-xs.jpg 300w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/5/responsive/1-7-1024x413-sm.jpg 480w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/5/responsive/1-7-1024x413-md.jpg 768w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/5/responsive/1-7-1024x413-lg.jpg 1024w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/5/responsive/1-7-1024x413-xl.jpg 1360w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/5/responsive/1-7-1024x413-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure></figure><p></p><p></p><p>Code upkeep without exponential human interaction I think is the first and biggest option. The main win is integrations with Git repositories and maintaining both new and old code. This primarily would help reduce technical debit on virtually every project its run on.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Mintlify sits firmly in the Software Development Tools category and as such requires heavy API integrations like Heptabase in a previous spotlight. Software tools as a whole is estimated to reach $158B globally in 2022.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Visit their <a href="https://www.mintlify.com/introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="website">website</a> to learn more.</p><p></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on July 20, 2023</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://z13o.com/tags/startups/">Startups</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://z13o.com/authors/author/" rel="author">Author</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://z13o.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://z13o.com/how-twofold-spaces-transform-your-furnitures-to-make-your-home-more-spacious.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> How Twofold Spaces Transform Your Furnitures To Make Your Home More Spacious</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://z13o.com/how-to-be-a-young-founder.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> How To Be A Young Founder </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://z13o.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-09-30T00:00" class="feed__date">September 30, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://z13o.com/how-to-compete-with-giants.html">How To Compete With Giants</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-05-26T19:00" class="feed__date">May 26, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://z13o.com/meatable-satisfy-the-worlds-appetite-for-meat-without-harming-animals.html">Meatable - satisfy the worldâ€™s appetite for meat without harming animals.</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://z13o.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://z13o.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
