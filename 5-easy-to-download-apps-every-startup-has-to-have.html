These are the most basic and essential tools you need for your business. The most popular and widely used productivity suites are Microsoft 365 and Google workspace. Both of these are industry-leading productivity suites. You can go with either one of these</p><p></p><p></p><h5>Graphic design app</h5><p></p><p></p><p>To develop a strong brand identity, you will need to design great quality visuals for your business. A graphic design app will take care of this.</p><p></p><p></p><p>These visuals include logos and other business visuals. Canva is the best graphic design app available right now. It will give you access to thousands of customizable design templates, stock photos, royalty-free videos, graphics and much more. Canva has a free version and a paid version. The paid version will unlock over 600,000 templates. However, its free version is quite good too and has many features.</p><p></p><p></p><h5>Website or online store</h5><p></p><p></p><p>There are many website-building platforms available these days. You need to choose the right option although it might be difficult. We have made making that choice easier for you. If your website is not selling any products or services then you can go for square space because of its reasonable pricing. It's very easy to create a website with square space because of its drag and drop elements to create and modify web pages. There are many attractive templates to choose from. Their customer service is also good and will help you out with any problem you face.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Another option is WordPress. It's a free and open-source content management system. However, building a website with WordPress requires a bit more technical knowledge. You can consider hiring a web developer if you want to go with WordPress.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Check out <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/blog/learn-wordpress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="Want to Learn WordPress? Start with These Resources">Want to Learn WordPress? Start with These Resources</a> to learn more.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Now let's talk about what you should go for if you are building an online store. Many beginners just embed a PayPal button on their web pages to handle financial transactions but that is not the right way to do it. You will need a fully functional store and a platform that will allow you to build that store. Big commerce and Shopify are the big names in this space. They are packed with tons of features to help you build your dream store.</p><p></p><p></p><h5>An Email Marketing Tool</h5><p></p><p></p><p>Email marketing is very powerful. It can provide a fantastic return on investment. E-newsletters are also a great way to share content with your audience. Doing this will not only build great brand awareness but also improve your SEO.</p><p></p><p></p><p>E-newsletter apps with free plans are Getresponse and Aweber. Many online business owners undermine email marketing. This approach is a big mistake. If done right, email marketing can do wonders for your business. Our favourite app for email marketing is Getresponse because of its cheap pricing and reliability.</p><p></p><p></p><h5>CRM</h5><p></p><p></p><p>CRM is customer relationship management. It refers to cloud-based software that allows business owners to track and manage the relationship with their leads and clients. A CRM app will allow you to organize leads, track communication with leads and clients, allocate tasks to your team, manage your sales pipeline and manage customer inquiries. One effective CRM app that you can use for your business is Hubspot. It comes with a very functional free version. Other options with reasonable pricing are Capsule and Nimble.</p><p></p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on July 20, 2023</div><div class="post__share"></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio box"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://z13o.com/authors/author/" title="The Author">The Author</a></h4><p>Collective account for multiple editors.Â </p></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="https://z13o.com/how-to-compete-with-giants.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><img src="https://z13o.com/media/posts/36/responsive/3-1-scaled-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="" height="1707" width="2560"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>How To Compete With Giants</h5></div></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a href="https://z13o.com/how-to-compete-with-giants.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>How To Compete With Giants</h5></div><img src="https://z13o.com/media/posts/36/responsive/3-1-scaled-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="" height="1707" width="2560"></a></div></nav><div class="post__related box"><h3 class="box__title">Related posts</h3><div class="post__related-wrap"><figure class="post__related-item"><a href="https://z13o.com/4-ways-startups-waste-money.html" class="c-card__image"><img src="https://z13o.com/media/posts/22/responsive/2-1-scaled-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="1707" width="2560" alt=""></a><figcaption><h4 class="post__related-title"><a href="https://z13o.com/4-ways-startups-waste-money.html" class="inverse">4 Ways Startups Waste Money</a></h4><time datetime="2022-09-16T00:00" class="u-small">September 16, 2022</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article></main><div class="sidebar"><section class="box authors"><h3 class="box__title">Authors</h3><ul class="authors__cotainer"><li class="authors__item"><div><a href="https://z13o.com/authors/author/" class="authors__title">The Author</a> <span class="u-small">Post: 36</span></div></li></ul></section><section class="box"><h3 class="box__title">Tags</h3><ul class="tags"><li><a href="https://z13o.com/tags/guides/">Guides</a> <span class="u-small">(8)</span></li><li><a href="https://z13o.com/tags/startups/">Startups</a> <span class="u-small">(23)</span></li><li><a href="https://z13o.com/tags/tech/">Tech</a> <span class="u-small">(21)</span></li></ul></section></div><footer class="footer"><a class="footer__logo" href="https://z13o.com/"><img src="https://z13o.com/media/website/z13o-low-resolution-logo-white-on-transparent-background-300x86.png" alt="z13o" width="300" height="86"></a><nav><ul class="footer__nav"></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
