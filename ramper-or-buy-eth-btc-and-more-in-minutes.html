This type of software is however not easy for everybody to use. There are many leading wallets used worldwide including coinbase, ZenGo, crypto.com, ledger, and binance. The global Cryptocurrency Hardware Wallet market size is projected to reach US$ 1220.1 million by 2027, from US$ 167.7 million in 2020, at a CAGR of 33.7% during 2021-2027.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The very basic step which annoys most of the users onboarding web3 is to connect the wallet which is a big hindrance. It's a tough job for beginners who have never interacted with decentralized applications earlier in their life. One has to take multiple steps to use decentralized applications. Firstly one has to download a specific wallet and it's a browser extension to sign up, also to store a private key, and transfer crypto into a specific decentralized application's wallet through an exchange.</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figure class="wp-image-832"><img loading="lazy" src="https://z13o.com/media/posts/26/1-4-1024x455.jpg" alt="bitcoins" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://z13o.com/media/posts/26/responsive/1-4-1024x455-xs.jpg 300w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/26/responsive/1-4-1024x455-sm.jpg 480w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/26/responsive/1-4-1024x455-md.jpg 768w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/26/responsive/1-4-1024x455-lg.jpg 1024w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/26/responsive/1-4-1024x455-xl.jpg 1360w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/26/responsive/1-4-1024x455-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure></figure><p></p><p></p><h5>Ramper</h5><p></p><p></p><p>Enter Ramper, a company that provides simple login for blockchain applications to remove friction preventing the adoption of web3. It is making this task easier for its users by removing the friction that is to connect a wallet. The company was founded in 2022 and is based in San Francisco, California.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The leading investors include Polygon, #HASHED, and Terra. There are no hidden fees and also there is no charge for using their SDK/API. Its team includes Facebook, Tesla, Uber, Google, Apple, Compass, Toss, and Goldman Sachs. It has built products & infra to make web3 user-friendly for everyone.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Their first product is a suite of SDK/APIs that allows dApps to onboard users quickly without prior crypto knowledge. Its users can log in and sign transactions without the need to have a wallet client or its supporting browser extension.</p><p></p><p></p><h5>Services</h5><p></p><p></p><p>Ramper has designed and implemented their data management system that when a user is created, several things happen on the user’s local device (mobile/web browser): Firstly a new wallet (public address + private key) is created. Secondly, the private key is encrypted with a machine-generated high entropy Data Encryption Key (DEK), and envelope encryption is performed. Thirdly, DEK is sent to a third party (currently AWS KMS) to be encrypted with a Customer Master Key (CMK). And Lastly, The encrypted private key (encrypted by DEK) and the encrypted DEK (encrypted by CMK) are then stored in Ramper’s cloud infrastructure (GCP/Firebase).&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p>There are many interesting features which are coming very soon. It includes Multi-factor authentication which includes enabling OTP code, 2FA, and recovery email. Also, Multi chain compatibility will be providing SDK/API solutions for all the major chains. Other features include the Fiat on-ramp solution which would allow users to swap fiat for crypto in-app and Open source delegated key management architecture.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Visit their <a href="https://www.ramper.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="website">website</a> to learn more.</p><p></p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on July 20, 2023</div><div class="post__share"></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio box"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://z13o.com/authors/author/" title="The Author">The Author</a></h4><p>Collective account for multiple editors. </p></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="https://z13o.com/how-taimba-connect-local-farmers-and-traders-to-reduce-food-wastes.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><img src="https://z13o.com/media/posts/27/responsive/12-scaled-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="" height="1707" width="2560"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>How Taimba Connect Local Farmers and Traders To Reduce Food Wastes</h5></div></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a href="https://z13o.com/how-advanx-health-provide-health-recommendations-by-using-dna-tests.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>How Advanx Health Provide Health Recommendations By Using DNA Tests</h5></div><img src="https://z13o.com/media/posts/28/responsive/10-scaled-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="" height="1707" width="2560"></a></div></nav><div class="post__related box"><h3 class="box__title">Related posts</h3><div class="post__related-wrap"><figure class="post__related-item"><a href="https://z13o.com/how-twofold-spaces-transform-your-furnitures-to-make-your-home-more-spacious.html" class="c-card__image"><img src="https://z13o.com/media/posts/12/responsive/15-scaled-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" height="1849" width="2560" alt=""></a><figcaption><h4 class="post__related-title"><a href="https://z13o.com/how-twofold-spaces-transform-your-furnitures-to-make-your-home-more-spacious.html" class="inverse">How Twofold Spaces Transform Your Furnitures To Make Your Home More Spacious</a></h4><time datetime="2022-09-09T00:00" class="u-small">September 9, 2022</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article></main><div class="sidebar"><section class="box authors"><h3 class="box__title">Authors</h3><ul class="authors__cotainer"><li class="authors__item"><div><a href="https://z13o.com/authors/author/" class="authors__title">The Author</a> <span class="u-small">Post: 36</span></div></li></ul></section><section class="box"><h3 class="box__title">Tags</h3><ul class="tags"><li><a href="https://z13o.com/tags/guides/">Guides</a> <span class="u-small">(8)</span></li><li><a href="https://z13o.com/tags/startups/">Startups</a> <span class="u-small">(23)</span></li><li><a href="https://z13o.com/tags/tech/">Tech</a> <span class="u-small">(21)</span></li></ul></section></div><footer class="footer"><a class="footer__logo" href="https://z13o.com/"><img src="https://z13o.com/media/website/z13o-low-resolution-logo-white-on-transparent-background-300x86.png" alt="z13o" width="300" height="86"></a><nav><ul class="footer__nav"></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
