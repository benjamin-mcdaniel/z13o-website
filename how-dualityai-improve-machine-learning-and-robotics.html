In 2020, the size of the market was estimated at around 55 billion U.S. dollars, with some 2.7 million units of industrial robots in operation worldwide. In 2028, the market size is projected to surpass 165 billion U.S. dollars.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Duality was founded by Apurva shah and Mike Taylor back in 2018. Apurva worked on the Oscar-winning film pipeline at Pixar Studios and Mike led teams to build massive field robots at Caterpillar Inc. The company is trying to build a metaverse for solving real-world problems which are powered by the best-in-class DigitalTwin simulator, Falcon. Every year, It partner with a selected group of researchers and engineers leveraging Falcon’s advanced photorealistic capabilities integrated with accurate physics and a wide selection of ready-to-use vehicles and assets.</p><p></p><p></p><p>According to TrendForce, the metaverse could propel global “smart” manufacturing revenue to $540 billion by 2025. Defining the “metaverse” is a difficult task, but one commonly accepted definition is a digital space populated by representations of people, places, and things. Through a combination of technologies including virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and AI, the metaverse that some futurists envision is an extension of the real world — albeit without the physical trappings.</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figure class="wp-image-870"><img loading="lazy" src="https://z13o.com/media/posts/6/1-12-1024x417.jpg" alt="networks" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://z13o.com/media/posts/6/responsive/1-12-1024x417-xs.jpg 300w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/6/responsive/1-12-1024x417-sm.jpg 480w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/6/responsive/1-12-1024x417-md.jpg 768w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/6/responsive/1-12-1024x417-lg.jpg 1024w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/6/responsive/1-12-1024x417-xl.jpg 1360w, https://z13o.com/media/posts/6/responsive/1-12-1024x417-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure></figure><p></p><p></p><p>The company’s team holds over 50 patents across robotics, simulation, and visualization, and the headquarters are located in San Mateo, California. Also, the team is spread across three continents making sure to be singular in focus.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The company makes sure to lead together outstanding proficiency in engineering, game engines, and robotics to manufacture synthetic images of compound environments in the robotics industry. It focuses on Research and development to innovate and introduce new products and services, to apprentice with customers to solve high-impact ML, robotics, and automation problems. Also, it pivots on simulating complex environmental outlines and how to make the scene work with real-time responses from sensors and machines.</p><p></p><p></p><p>According to Tony Garcia, Technical Lead: ” I help to create projects and develop workflows in real-time engines to run in Falcon (our digital twin simulator). This has included building interactive scenarios and proof of concepts, as well as helping to create large photorealistic worlds that run efficiently in Falcon”.</p><p></p><p></p><p>At Duality the company source synthetic data for enterprise teams working on machine learning, robotics, and workflow automation. Data generation for perception, dynamics, and controls has improved in leaps and bounds thanks to GPUs and real-time game engines. Generating behavior data, however, that requires large-scale human-in-the-loop simulation remains a tough nut to crack. The vision at Duality is to turn the serious play into productive data and they believe that the metaverse is the place to do it.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Duality is a recipient of Epic’s MegaGrant, which recognizes innovative projects leveraging Unreal Engine. They are also the participants of the Autodesk residency program, which strategically aligns them to bridge the cutting-edge technologies of visual effects with the engineering tools of robotics. AWS, their cloud partner, brings scale and security to their metaverse.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Customizable, user targeted advertising has become mostly commonplace today, whose advertising approach has obvious limitations when one considers the full breadth of ad personalization options that could only be achieved with Duality’s Falcon platform, whereby the company gain the ability to compose highly customized ads served to consumers in real time – in a efficient method that wasn’t possible earlier.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Leveraging advanced digital twin simulation technology, company has gained the chance to be in the service of real time highly personalized ads depicting several products at once, grouped in an intuitive manner that’s more pleasing, engaging and/or realistic to the individual consumer. This ultimately makes for a more effective advertisement – one that makes the most of the available real estate on the web page, and ultimately makes the most of the overall selling opportunity. And all of this can be achieved cost effectively for online advertisers.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Visit their <a href="https://www.duality.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="website">website</a> to learn more.</p><p></p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on July 20, 2023</div><div class="post__share"></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio box"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://z13o.com/authors/author/" title="The Author">The Author</a></h4><p>Collective account for multiple editors. </p></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="https://z13o.com/how-to-make-a-wireframe-in-figma.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><img src="https://z13o.com/media/posts/20/responsive/1_RWriD6Jy4Ssd0rFjhLNt_w-xs.png" loading="lazy" alt="" height="630" width="1200"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>How to make a wireframe in figma</h5></div></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a href="https://z13o.com/how-to-make-a-wireframe-in-figma.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>How to make a wireframe in figma</h5></div><img src="https://z13o.com/media/posts/20/responsive/1_RWriD6Jy4Ssd0rFjhLNt_w-xs.png" loading="lazy" alt="" height="630" width="1200"></a></div></nav></footer></article></main><div class="sidebar"><section class="box authors"><h3 class="box__title">Authors</h3><ul class="authors__cotainer"><li class="authors__item"><div><a href="https://z13o.com/authors/author/" class="authors__title">The Author</a> <span class="u-small">Post: 36</span></div></li></ul></section><section class="box"><h3 class="box__title">Tags</h3><ul class="tags"><li><a href="https://z13o.com/tags/guides/">Guides</a> <span class="u-small">(8)</span></li><li><a href="https://z13o.com/tags/startups/">Startups</a> <span class="u-small">(23)</span></li><li><a href="https://z13o.com/tags/tech/">Tech</a> <span class="u-small">(21)</span></li></ul></section></div><footer class="footer"><a class="footer__logo" href="https://z13o.com/"><img src="https://z13o.com/media/website/z13o-low-resolution-logo-white-on-transparent-background-300x86.png" alt="z13o" width="300" height="86"></a><nav><ul class="footer__nav"></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
